🔍 Pathfinder Visualizer (BFS, DFS, DLS) – Flask Web App
This project is a Flask-based web visualizer for graph pathfinding algorithms like BFS, DFS, and DLS. It includes two modes:

✅ Auto-Generate Graph — Randomly generate graph & visualize search

✅ Manual-Generate Graph — Let users build the graph manually (via Tkinter/other)

🌐 Features
📊 Visualizes BFS, DFS, and DLS step-by-step

🎨 Beautiful front-end using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

🔄 Dynamic interaction with Python backend

⚙️ Integration with autogenrate.py logic to show nodes, steps, and paths

📁 Organized Flask project structure

✅ Future support for manual graph drawing via megenrate.py
